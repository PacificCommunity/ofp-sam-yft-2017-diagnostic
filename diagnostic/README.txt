The files contained in this folder are for the model presented as the "diagnostic case" in the
stock assessment report. The SC decided that management recommendations should be made from a
suite of models based on the structural uncertainty grid. Therefore if the files are needed to
run any alternative models, such as those used in the structural uncertainty grid, they will be
made readily available by contacting ofpdatahelp@spc.int.
